# Proof of concepts and exploits for IOPSYS devices
This is a collection of scripts which abuse various vulnerabilities on devices running Inteno's IOPSYS. More details about each vulnerability can be found on [my blog](https://neonsea.uk/blog/).

These scripts have only been tested on Linux, but they may also work on other operating systems.
### Dependencies
The Python scripts require Python 3.6+ and the submodule `websocket-client`:
```
# pip install websocket-client
```
Furthermore, `cve-2017-17867.py` and `cve-2018-14533.py` also require the unix tool `smbclient`, which you can install using your distro's package manager.
### Usage
Usage for each script is specified at the top of the script as a comment.
